# MORSE Code Automation

This project is also known as ```mcauto```.

## Synopsis

I wrote the MORSE Code Automation project to use it with a standalone radio transceiver. At the moment, the program is able to only encode the texts that you type-in. It will use the PC Speaker to emit the MORSE codes. In the future I am planning to build a hardware interface on the parallel port to handle real relay manipulation and real-time MORSE code decoding.
